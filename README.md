This project has been made according to the given instructions for Homework 2 (and HW1) (course: Introduction to XR Systems).

In this project, I modified the planet and the moon colours (planet is blue and moon is white/cream). 
Additionally, I set up the moon to orbit the planet along both the X and Y axes, creating a more interesting 
and dynamic orbital movement. These changes enhance the visual variety and make the scene more engaging.

For Homework 2, I also added several objects to the scene that can be examined with the magnifying glass. 
Furthermore, I included some hidden objects, such as text on the wall and a watering can, to encourage exploration. 
The magnifying glass only works correctly when it is upright; when the glass is rotated, 
the magnifier camera rotates with it, which is not the intended behaviour, but I could not figure out a solution.

Grab functionality with one hand does not work perfectly, but it works correctly when using both hands. 
Finally, I implemented the extra credit feature for double rotation, which allows objects to rotate at twice 
the normal speed when a specific button (for this build it is A -button for both controllers) is pressed during a grab.
