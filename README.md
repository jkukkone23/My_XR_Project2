This project has been been made according to the given instructions on Homework 1 (course: Introduction to XR Systems).

In this project, I modified the planet and the moon colours (planet is blue and moon is white/cream). 
Additionally, I set up the moon to orbit the planet along both the X and Y axes, creating a 
more interesting and dynamic orbital movement. These changes enhance the visual variety 
and make the scene more engaging.
